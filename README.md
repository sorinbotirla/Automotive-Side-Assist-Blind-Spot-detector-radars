# Automotive-Side-Assist-Blind-Spot-detector-radars
A blind spot radar detection system compatible with any car, focused on mitigating fake detections triggered by walls or static side objects while keeping the real vehicle detections only.

This is not your regular aliexpress toy, it features adjustable settings within a web app, includes a data logger and more. And still, it doesn't hurt the wallet.
